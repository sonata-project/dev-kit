Contribute to Sonata Project
============================

Sonata is an open source project with a very diverse community, where people from all over the world
contribute their work, with everyone benefitting from friendly help and advice, and kindly
helping others in return.

We have two main channels opened:

* `Symfony Slack <https://symfony.com/slack>`_ on the `#sonata <https://symfony-devs.slack.com/messages/sonata>`_ channel
* Github issues (only for bugs and feature request)

Sonata respects the Symfony's conventions about contributing to the code.
