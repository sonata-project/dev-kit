# It's auto-generated by sonata-project/dev-kit package.

{#
MANDATORY
An array with the name of the branches for which you want to publish docs
It doesn't have to be an exhaustive list of your repository branches, but
only the main repository branches (past or present)
#}
branches:
{% for branch in project.branchesReverse %}
    - {{ branch.name }}
{% endfor %}

{#
MANDATORY
A subset of the 'branches' array which lists only the branch(es) that
you currently maintain. We build the docs of these branch(es) frequently,
whereas we build the docs of the other branch(es) much less frequently
#}
maintained_branches:
{% for branch in project.branchesReverse %}
    - {{ branch.name }}
{% endfor %}

{#
MANDATORY
The location of your RST doc files, defined as a relative directory
If all the branches defined in the 'branches' option use the same
directory, then you can define it as a string
#}
doc_dir: 'doc/'

{#
OPTIONAL
This is the branch used to read the docs by default (and it's mapped as
'current' in the public URL to generate stable URLs for your docs).
It should match the branch you use to publish the stable releases.
This value is optional because we assign it automatically to the
default branch" of your repository as returned by the GitHub API
#}
current_branch: {{ project.stableBranch|default(project.unstableBranch).name }}

{#
OPTIONAL
This is the branch used to publish the next versions of your bundle.
For bundles it's common that 'current_branch' and 'dev_branch' are the same.
That's why we automatically assign to it the same value as 'current_branch'
#}
dev_branch: {{ project.unstableBranch.name }}

{#
OPTIONAL
This is the version that future releases of your bundle will use.
It's used in some symfony.com labels to avoid using the generic
"master" or "main" labels.
